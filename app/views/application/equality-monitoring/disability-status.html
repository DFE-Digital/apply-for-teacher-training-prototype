        <p class="govuk-body">Under the Equality Act 2010, a person has a disability 'if they have a physical or mental impairment, and the impairment has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his or her ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities'. 'Substantial' is defined by the Act as 'more than minor or trivial'. An impairment is considered to have a long term effect if:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>It has lasted for at least 12 months</li>
          <li>It is likely to last for at least 12 months, or</li>
          <li>it is likely to last for the rest of the life of the person.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">Normal day-to-day activities are not defined in the Act, but in general they are things people do on a regular or daily basis. The definition has a very wide meaning as both work, study and non â€“work activities are covered e.g. communicating, reading, writing, using a computer as well as washing, walking and getting dressed. 'Normal' means normal for people generally, rather than for a particular individual.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Employment case law has highlighted that work activity does not have to be 'day-to-day' but covers activities that are required to participate in professional life e.g. activities used to select individuals for recruitment and promotion.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Only serious visual impairments are covered by the Equality Act 2010. For example, a person whose eyesight can be corrected through the use of prescription lenses is not covered by the Act; neither is an inability to distinguish between red and green. The same logic does not apply to hearing aids. If someone needs to wear a hearing aid, then they are likely to be covered by the Act. However, both hearing and visual impairments have to have a substantial adverse effect on the ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities in order for a person to be covered by the Act.</p>
