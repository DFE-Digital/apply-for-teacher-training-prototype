  <p class="govuk-body">We ask about your residency because it helps teacher training providers assess how much you should pay for your course (unless it’s a salaried course).</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">There are 2 levels of fees. If you’re eligible for home fees, you'll pay less than if you’re eligible for international fees.</p>

  <!-- <p class="govuk-body">You should select ‘yes’ if you've only been away temporarily. For example, for holidays or a gap year. </p> -->

    Will you have been living in the UK or Ireland for 3 years by the time the course starts?
