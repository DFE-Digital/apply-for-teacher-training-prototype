<p class="govuk-body">You might benefit from extra support if you’re disabled, have a mental health condition or educational needs.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If you choose to tell us you need support, we’ll let your training provider know. They can then make adjustments so you can attend an interview or do the training.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Examples of support could be:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>organising equipment like a hearing loop or an adapted keyboard</li>
  <li>putting you in touch with support staff if you have a mental health condition</li>
  <li>making sure classrooms are wheelchair accessible</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">If the help you need is not covered by your provider making adjustments, you might also be able to get support from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work">Access to Work</a>. This could include a grant to help cover the costs of practical support in the workplace.</p>
