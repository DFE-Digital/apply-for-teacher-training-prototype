  <li>your criminal record in the UK (they'll do an enhanced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service/about#dbs-checks">DBS check)</a> and abroad where relevant</li>
  <li>whether you’ve been banned from teaching or working with children</li>
  <li>your professional behaviour, such as whether you’ve been removed from teacher training and what your referees say about you</li>
