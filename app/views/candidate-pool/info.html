            How does application sharing work?
          </h1>

          <p class="govuk-body">Training providers can search a list of candidates who have chosen to share their application details with them. If they find someone suitable, they can invite them to apply.</p>

          {% set htmlWhatInfo %}
          <p class="govuk-body">Application details that the provider can see include:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>your qualifications</li>
            <li>work history and unpaid experience</li>
            <li>your most recent personal statement</li>
            <li>basic information about where you have applied to before</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="govuk-body">Training providers cannot see:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>your full name or date of birth</li>
            <li>any personal statements apart from your most recent one</li>
            <li>reasons why your past applications ended without success</li>
          </ul>
          {% endset %}


          {% set htmlWhen %}
          <p class="govuk-body">Training providers can only invite you to apply if you do not have an application in progress with another training provider. In progress applications will be in one of these states:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>submitted less than 30 working days ago (and not yet withdrawn or rejected)</li>
            <li>interviewing</li>
            <li>offered</li>
            <li>conditions pending</li>
            <li>recruited</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="govuk-body">This means you will be visible in the list when all of your application choices are:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>rejected by the training provider</li>
            <li>withdrawn by you or the training provider</li>
            <li>inactive - this means you have not heard back from the provider for 30 working days since submitting your application.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="govuk-body">When you submit a new application choice, you will no longer be visible to other training providers and they will not be able to invite you to apply.</p>
          {% endset %}


          {% set htmlHowMany %}
          <p class="govuk-body">This process works alongside the current applications process. You can submit a maximum 4 applications at a time. When an application becomes inactive, is rejected or withdrawn, you can submit another choice, up to a maximum of 15 total applications in a single recruitment cycle.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">If you are invited to apply to a course and you submit an application, it will count towards your total application choices.</p>
          {% endset %}


          {% set htmlMoreLikely %}
          <p class="govuk-body">Being invited to apply does not guarantee you a place on a course. The training provider will still review your full application in the same way they would if you had applied to them without being invited to. If your application meets their criteria, they will invite you to interview.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">You should continue to find courses that you are interested in and submit applications yourself. Do not wait to be invited by training providers.</p>
