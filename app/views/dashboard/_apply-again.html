  <p class="govuk-body">If now’s the right time, you can still apply for courses that start this academic year.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">Here’s what you could do next:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">

    <li>Find another course with a training provider that will accept an equivalency test. You can also take your GCSE exams at any age if you do not have them or you can retake them to improve your grades.</li>

    <li>Train to teach without a degree by doing an <a href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/train-to-be-a-teacher/if-you-dont-have-a-degree">undergraduate degree</a> in teacher training or becoming a <a href="https://getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/become-a-further-education-teacher">further education</a> teacher.</li>

    <li>Improve your subject knowledge, look at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum">national curriculum</a> to find out what areas you need to know more about. You can also find a course in a different subject.</li>

    <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/replacement-exam-certificate">Get a certified statement of your exam results</a> if you did your GCSEs and A levels in the UK. You should also be able to request a copy of your degree certificate from the organisation where you studied in the UK.</li>
    
    <li> If you got your qualifications outside the UK, you should be able to request copies of your school results and degree from the places where you did them.</li>
  
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">To talk about your options, get in touch with a <a href="https://beta-adviser-getintoteaching.education.gov.uk/">teacher training adviser</a>.</p>
