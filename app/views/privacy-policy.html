  <p class="govuk-body-m">Apply for teacher training and Manage teacher training applications are run by the Department for Education (‘we’).</p>

  <p class="govuk-body-m">Any information we collect when you use our services will be used and looked after by:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>the Department for Education, and/or</li>
    <li>the teacher training providers the candidate applies to</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body-m">This means we’re joint data controllers, as well as data processors, for your information (defined by data protection law).</p>

  <p class="govuk-body-m">Apply for teacher training and Manage teacher training applications are new services.
  We’re confident that they’ve met our security standards, but we’ll continue to run
  security tests as we improve the service. Like with any digital service, there’s
  always a chance of data breaches happening.</p>

  <h2 id="what-personal-data-we-collect" class="govuk-heading-l">What personal data we collect</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body-m">The personal data we collect will depend on whether you’re a candidate, a referee, or a staff member at a teacher training provider.</p>

  <h3 id="what-data-we-collect-if-you-re-a-candidate" class="govuk-heading-m">What data we collect if you’re a candidate</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body-m">For example, we’ll look at any feedback you give us about our services so we can improve them.</p>

  <h2 id="using-your-data-lawfully" class="govuk-heading-l">Using your data lawfully</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body-m">We need to use personal data for the purposes mentioned above. Most of these purposes are a public task (defined in data protection law).</p>

  <p class="govuk-body-m">However, if we contacted you asking for a reference, this was in our legitimate interests (defined in data protection law) because we need references to process applications.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body-m">If you give a reference, we use your data to meet our public task (processing applications, building a better service and improving policy). To help us do this, we’ll ask for your consent (defined in data protection law) to be contacted for user research.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body-m">If you’re a candidate or a referee, we’ll also ask for your consent before using cookies to get statistics from Google Analytics.</p>

  <h2 id="who-we-share-your-data-with" class="govuk-heading-l">Who we share your data with</h2>

  <p class="govuk-body-m">We need to share personal data for the purposes mentioned above.</p>

      <li>get statistics for internal use</li>

  </ul>

  <h3 id="sharing-candidate-data-with-referees" class="govuk-heading-m">Sharing candidate data with referees</h3>

  <p class="govuk-body-m">We’ll share candidate names with referees so the referee can identify the candidate and give a reference.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body-m">We may need to share a bit more information to help the referee identify the candidate, such as how the candidate knows the referee.</p>

  <h3 id="sharing-candidate-data-with-ucas" class="govuk-heading-m">Sharing candidate data with UCAS</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body-m">We’ll share candidate data with UCAS.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body-m">This is so UCAS can check applications across UCAS and Apply for teaching training.</p>
