  <p class="govuk-body">Dear Debroah Lueilwitz</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Jane Doe has accepted an offer from West Lancashire SCITT for a place on a teacher training course. </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">They’ve said that you can give them a reference. </p>

  <p class="govuk-body">You’ll need to: </p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

    {% if type == 'character' %}

      <li>give factual information which can be used to check their application, for example about activities you’ve done together</li>

    {% elif type == 'professional' or type == 'school' %}

      <li>give factual information which can be used to check their application, for example about their role and responsibilities at work</li>

    {% else %}

      <li>give factual information which can be used to check their application, for example about their academic performance</li>

    {% endif %}
    <li>say whether you have any concerns about them working with children</li>

  </ul>


  <p class="govuk-body">Use this link to give the reference as soon as you can:</p>

  <p class="govuk-body"><a href="/reference">http://localhost:3000/reference?token=onNYS8Uvzs2nicqd5htb</a></p>

  <p class="govuk-body">If you cannot give a reference, use the link to tell Jane Doe so they can ask someone else. You will then receive no further emails about this.</p>
