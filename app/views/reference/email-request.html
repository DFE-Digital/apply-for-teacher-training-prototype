  <p class="govuk-body">Dear Debroah Lueilwitz,</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Jane Doe has accepted an offer from University College London for a place on a teacher training course. </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">They’ve said that you can give them a reference. Their place on the course can only be confirmed after University College London has received their references.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">Use this link to give the reference as soon as you can:</p>

  <p class="govuk-body"><a href="/reference">http://localhost:3000/reference?token=onNYS8Uvzs2nicqd5htb</a></p>

  <p class="govuk-body">You can also use the link to say that you cannot give a reference, so that Jane Doe knows to ask someone else.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">If you give a reference you’ll need to say: </p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>how you know Jane Doe and how long you’ve known them for</li>
    <li>whether you know of any reason why they should not train to be a teacher</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">Your reference will not be sent to Jane Doe.</p>
